# dyn2rel3
`dyn2rel3` is a MATLAB package to convert particle data between two subtomogram averaging softwares: [Dynamo](https://www.dynamo-em.org/) and [RELION-3.1](https://relion.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.1/).

This subversion `dyn2rel3` supports export of a `Dynamo`-style particles table as `.tbl` file and associated tomograms to the `RELION-3.1`-style `.star` files for particles and tomograms.
