# dyn2rel
`dyn2rel` is a set of MATLAB scripts to convert particle data between two subtomogram averaging softwares: [Dynamo](https://www.dynamo-em.org/) and [RELION-4.0](https://relion.readthedocs.io/en/release-4.0/).

This version supports export of a `Dynamo`-style particles table as `.tbl` file to the `RELION-4.0`-style `.star` particle file.
